# MSC website on GITHUB
A template for the website is here: [caltech-msc.github.io](https://caltech-msc.github.io)
(note: to make it as real as possible, I just added random blurbs of text and some nice pictures of caltech lol)
The MSC website will now be hosted on GitHub. This will allow everyone to be able to collaborate and help make the website amazing for the public. A copy of all website files will be on a folder in the server, and someone familiar with GitHub will update the website every week or so.

# Important:
Hello all! This website is still in the works, so it would be great to receive possible tips and advice on how to make the website better. Please feel free to comment on the design and add tips on how to improve the functionality of the website!!

## Things you can do
* Add your contact card to the group page, optional info to display is picture, email, cell, or personal page (Scroll down)
* Add your own, personal page, with functions such as displaying a bio, a calendar with your schedule, anything. 
* Add your own collaborative group page, either hosted on the main website repository or on your own repository.
* Add a cool research article you found interesting on the home page and in the research archive.
* Add your own exciting research and present it through a slideshow.

No HTML/CSS experience necessary, my goal is to create ways to make editing the website as easy as possible.

## Current list of tasks:
* Creating a google form for adding articles to the pages
* Creating html template for group and personal pages
* Updating "About" section so it will become editable
* Updating the text of all pages instead of random Latin blurbs
* Updating "Visiting Us?" page to include more information
Please note that all of these tasks require time, so please be patient! If you have HTML experience and would like to help, please feel free to do so and send me an email as well :)
